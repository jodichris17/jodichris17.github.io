The increasing popularity of DevOps software development methodologies has led to shorter and more agile lifecycles in which software is released and deployed in minutes or hours rather than the days, weeks, or even months required under traditional practices. However, many development teams still experience delays in getting releases into production due to the security considerations that are traditionally brought to bear at the end of the lifecycle. To address this, organizations are more and more frequently adopting a DevSecOps approach.
