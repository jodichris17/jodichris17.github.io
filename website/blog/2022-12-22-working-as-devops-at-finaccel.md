I worked at finaccel as a DevOps Engineer for about one year (2021-2022). Joining this company is the next step in my career after my previous position was a System Engineer. In this company, I have a position as a DevOps Engineer where the work culture and technology used are slightly different from my previous job. Here are some experiences that I can share while working at Finaccel.

<!--truncate-->

FinAccel is a financial technology company that leverages deep data analytics across users digital footprint to automate credit risk scoring and access to credit in Southeast Asia, the 7th largest economy in the world. FinAccel’s flagship product, Kredivo “Buy now, Pay later”, enables e-commerce buyers to apply and qualify for instant credit and pay back over time. Merchants using Kredivo benefit from providing Point of Sale financing using a 2-click checkout to all eligible buyers.

## Applying to Finaccel

I am interested in applying for a job at this company because I see this company continuing to grow and provide services that are widely used by people in various circles. The application process is quite fast and straightforward, there is no psychological test or medical checkup like my previous company hiring process. first I applied through kalibrr.com, then about 2 weeks later I got a call for an interview process which consisted of:

1. **Job brief & Company overview**
2. **Technical Career Discussion with Hiring Managers**

## Skills to develop
There are several skills that I got when I worked at finaccel, such as:
### Soft skills
- Ability to see root cause of the problem, and not brainlessly trying to solve the task you’ve been given. Why did your task even appear? Maybe it’s aimed at solving a special case that you can generalize and solve a group of problems instead? Don't limit your thinking to the task your manager has given you.
- Timely communication. Remember that you are working in a team, and it’s very important to communicate the status of your task in a timely manner. Otherwise you can slow down an entire team.
- Ability to work independently. It’s important to be an autonomous engineer who does not require micromanagement. You should be able to get answers to most of the questions you have on your own. Do not confuse it with getting stuck on the problem though. If you encounter a problem that you cannot solve on your own (you have already gone through all the options available to you), then contact your manager or mentor to get help.
- Ability to ask for and receive feedback. Before making key decisions while working on a project, consider different approaches and list the pros and cons of both. Show your thoughts to your colleagues and find out what they think about it.
- Ability to deliver information. At any stage of your career, you will have to carry out discussions and suggest your ideas to different people. It is important to be able to concisely and clearly convey your point of view. Even better if you can document it well in writing.
### Technical Skills
- Linux System Administration. 
- Cloud Skills & Best Practices.
- Infrastructure as a Code.
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
- Source Code Management (version control). 
- Troubleshooting.
- Log analysis.
## Overall
What I like the most about my job is the fact that I learn something new everyday. These are not necessarily some innovative technologies, but often you learn very important soft skills - project management, business skills, communication among team members for the most efficient result. 

I think, like everyone else, I don't really like working on repetitive tasks that I have to dedicate a certain amount of time to weekly. These are the tasks that are quite difficult to automate.

Also, in situations where you are working on important projects, you may encounter bureaucracy in one form or another, which undoubtedly slows down your work.
