FinAccel is one of the fastest growing fintech companies and a leading BNPL platform with lofty ambitions. Starting with instant ecommerce financing, which integrates at merchant checkout, we are on a goal to disrupt unsecured lending in Southeast Asia, one of the fastest growing economic regions globally. Our flagship product, Kredivo, qualifies buyers for instant ecommerce and offline purchase financing as well as personal loans at rates, which are much lower than other providers. We do this by using breakthrough technology and data science to unlock unprecedented insights about credit risk and fraud from multiple data sources: phone, social networks, telco, financial and location data.
