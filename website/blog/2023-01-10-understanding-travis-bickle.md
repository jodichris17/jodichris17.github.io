Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is the best film I've ever watched so far, DeNiro's performance as Travis Bickle so surpasses any doubt as to the content of this film that I couldn't take my eyes off him. I have watched this film many times to understand what was going through Travis Bickle's mind along with the plot of the film.  So here are my thoughts about this film, especially about Travis Bickle as the main character which is very interesting to analyze.

Less than a year after the end of the Vietnam War, Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver was released on February 8th, 1976. Written by Paul Schrader, the film is a psychological character study of Robert De Niro’s Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who takes a job as a night shift cabbie. His late hours expose him to what he considers the scum of the earth, and his progressively deteriorating mental state leads him to a complete break and disillusionment with reality. A personal project for Scorsese, De Niro and especially Schrader, none of the three believed that the film would prove successful; in fact, Scorsese has admitted that their motivation for making it was simply because they had to. Well, of course, Taxi Driver wound up being one of the best films of the year; it was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won the Palme d’Or in Cannes three months after its American premiere.

This film is about loneliness, about the isolation of a man in a society full of scum. His objective is to finish with the scum of the streets. The story uses a taxi driver as a metaphor of loneliness and it has some kind of irony because we can see that a city which is full of people can be the most lonely place for a man. The long nights in the city, the night environment full of whores, junkies, pimps and thieves are the main elements of the world in which Travis Bickle lives. Travis is an misunderstood guy who is seeking desperately for some kind of company because as he says 'loneliness has followed me all my life, everywhere' but at the same time he seems not to do anything to avoid his situation and it is seen when he goes with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) to a porn cinema. At the end of the film the character makes real his most violent fantasies, with a look of certain soldiers from Vietnam, and he behaves like this because of his loneliness, his alienation and because he does not find any sense to his life. The violent behaviour becomes Travis into a hero, although he had killed many people and he could do it again. Although he acts with an extreme violence the spectator understand him and the reasons why he acts that way. The soundtrack of the film, which is composed by Bernard Herrmann, inspires some kind of loneliness and sometimes it is absolutely terrifying like in a horror film. This music and the slow camera showing the streets help to introduce the spectator into the world of Travis, to know what he is thinking about.

This is what makes Travis Bickle such an interesting and complex character. While nobody but the most obtuse viewer is actually cheering for him by the end and he is clearly presented as a pathetic and deeply flawed character, there are elements of his philosophy that speak to the darker side within all of us, to the side that wants to scream out against the injustices within our flawed society just as much as we understand deep down how wrong this sort of directionless, petty vigilante justice (that in Bickle’s case is never about actual justice but more about fuelling his own fantasy and self-image) would be. At the same time, the way he is ultimately lauded as a hero for his actions speaks to how shallow and manipulable society is as a whole, and how ultimately we are all complicit in creating men like Bickle even if we condemn their actions. This is of course part of the reason why the movie was criticised in some circles at the time by those who felt that on the surface it seemed to glorify the actions of men like Bickle and that art has a social responsibility to preserve moral order.

In general I cannot say any negative aspect of this film because I have not found anything bad. Although it is a film of the 70s it is not an old-fashioned movie because the essence of the story, the reality that is shown on it, can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence "You talking' to me?" which will remain in the history of cinema. This is an authentic masterpiece.
