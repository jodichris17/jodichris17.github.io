PT Primacom Interbuana (Primacom) is a leading communication solution provider in Indonesia that started the journey by providing connectivity services through a satellite communication system with a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT). As the market demands advanced communication network technology with greater efficiency, Primacom expands its business line by offering Fleet Management, Data Center, Teleport, Cloud, and Internet services.

I worked at Primacom as a System Engineer for one and a half years year (2020-2021). I work here as a fresh graduate, so working at this company is my first experience working professionally. Here are some experiences that I can share while working at Primacom.
## Applying to Primacom

The application process was fairly standard, first I applied through jobstreet, then about 1 months later I got a call for an interview process and consists of:
1. **Online Interview with HR**
2. **Psychological Test**
3. **Online User Interview**
4. **Online Interview with VP Engineering**
5. **Medical CheckUp**

## Skills to develop
There are several skills that I got when I worked at Primacom, such as:
### Soft skills
- Communication. Whether you work on a team or with clients, good communication is key. Being an effective and concise communicator can keep conflicts from arising.
- Time Management. Many careers require you to balance multiple responsibilities or projects at the same time. Effective time managers break large assignments into smaller chunks and finish them on time.
- Interpersonal Skills. When working as part of a diverse team, you may not always see eye to eye with others. Managers seek employees who listen to others' ideas and understand other points of view. Employees who can effectively communicate and proactively resolve conflicts without intervention make valuable team members.
- Problem-Solving. Many job interviews ask you to discuss a problem you've encountered and how you overcame it. Employers want to hire independent, driven professionals. Problem-solvers are able to analyze situations, incorporate input from others, and create an action plan to address the issue.
- Adaptability. No matter what your role, and no matter what your industry, the ability to adapt to change — and a positive attitude about change — go a long way toward growing a successful career.
### Technical Skills
- Network Administration.
- Linux System Administration. 
- Virtualization technology
- Very-small-aperture terminal(VSAT)
- On-premise infrastructure
## Overall

As a fresh graduate from the university, working at this company gave me an insight into how the professional world really is. I learned a lot while here, about how companies run their business, how the structure is in the company, and how each department carries out its respective functions to run the company's business. So I have to say that working in this company is a valuable experience and became the cornerstone for me in my next career path.
