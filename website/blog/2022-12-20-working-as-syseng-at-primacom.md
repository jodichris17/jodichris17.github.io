PT Primacom Interbuana (Primacom) is a leading communication solution provider in Indonesia that started the journey by providing connectivity services through a satellite communication system with a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT). As the market demands advanced communication network technology with greater efficiency, Primacom expands its business line by offering Fleet Management, Data Center, Teleport, Cloud, and Internet services.

I worked at Primacom as a System Engineer for one and a half years year (2020-2021). Here are some experiences that I can share while working at Primacom.

## Applying to Primacom

The application process was fairly standard, first I applied through jobstreet, then about 1 months later I got a call for an interview process and consists of:
1. **Online Interview with HR**
2. **Psychological Test**
3. **Online User Interview**
4. **Online Interview with VP Engineering**
5. **Medical CheckUp**

## Skills to develop
There are several skills that I got when I worked at Primacom, such as:
### Soft skills
- Ability to see root cause of the problem, and not brainlessly trying to solve the task you’ve been given. Why did your task even appear? Maybe it’s aimed at solving a special case that you can generalize and solve a group of problems instead? Don't limit your thinking to the task your manager has given you.
- Timely communication. Remember that you are working in a team, and it’s very important to communicate the status of your task in a timely manner. Otherwise you can slow down an entire team.
- Ability to work independently. It’s important to be an autonomous engineer who does not require micromanagement. You should be able to get answers to most of the questions you have on your own. Do not confuse it with getting stuck on the problem though. If you encounter a problem that you cannot solve on your own (you have already gone through all the options available to you), then contact your manager or mentor to get help.
- Ability to ask for and receive feedback. Before making key decisions while working on a project, consider different approaches and list the pros and cons of both. Show your thoughts to your colleagues and find out what they think about it.
- Ability to deliver information. At any stage of your career, you will have to carry out discussions and suggest your ideas to different people. It is important to be able to concisely and clearly convey your point of view. Even better if you can document it well in writing.
### Technical Skills
- Network Administration
- Linux System Administration. 
- Virtualization technology
- Very-small-aperture terminal(VSAT)
- On-premise infrastructure
