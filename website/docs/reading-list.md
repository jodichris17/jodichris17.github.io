### Books 2021

- [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens): The evolution of human beings from the cognitive revolution to the scientific revolution was vividly portrayed in the book by Harari. You will be mesmerized after knowing how from being another common species – vulnerable to every other animal out there- the Homo Sapiens has emerged as the sole controller of every other thing on the planet earth. Your perception about life and other objective aspects will completely be altered once you come to know how the agricultural revolution and the other developments of civilization have transformed the sapiens from free self-sufficient foragers to industrial slaves of their capitalist desire. Even though the author’s lack of understanding of Islam was evident in many cases throughout the book, it is a highly recommended book to rediscover the world in front of us and reform the perception we have about our lives.
